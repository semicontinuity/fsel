            - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**

                <thinking>
              * First, check if the memory-bank/ directory exists.

                <thinking>
              * If memory-bank DOES exist, skip immediately to `if_memory_bank_exists`.

            1. **Inform the User:**  
                "No Memory Bank was found. I recommend creating one to  maintain project context. Would you like to switch to Flow-Architect mode to do this?"
            2. **Conditional Actions:**
               * If the user declines:
                <thinking>
                I need to proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.
                </thinking>
                a. Inform the user that the Memory Bank will not be created.
                b. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'.
                c. Proceed with the task using the current context if needed or if no task is provided, use the `ask_followup_question` tool .
               * If the user agrees:
                Switch to Flow-Architect mode to create the Memory Bank.

              **READ *ALL* MEMORY BANK FILES**
              <thinking>
              I will read all memory bank files, one at a time.
              </thinking>
              Plan: Read all mandatory files sequentially.
              1. Read `productContext.md`
              2. Read `activeContext.md` 
              3. Read `systemPatterns.md` 
              4. Read `decisionLog.md` 
              5. Read `progress.md` 
              6. Set status to [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE] and inform user.
              7. Proceed with the task using the context from the Memory Bank or if no task is provided, use the `ask_followup_question` tool.

            
      general:
        status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."

            3. Memory Bank Synchronization:
                - Update all affected *.md files
                - Ensure cross-mode consistency
                - Preserve activity context
